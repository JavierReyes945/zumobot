One of the most used study cases in Control Theory is the Inverted Pendulum analysis, as it presents an unstable open-loop characteristic but is also possible to stabilize it on a closed-loop configuration.

Here we present the analysis of the Zumobot 32U4, a small robot available in the market. The Zumo 32U4 robot is a complete, versatile robot controlled by an Arduino-compatible ATmega32U4 microcontroller. The Zumo 32U4 robot can be programmed from a computer using any operating system that supports the Arduino environment.

% Start of Chapter 3 - Control Design

From the obtained model, it is clear that the system needs a controller to govern the signal control, proportionally to the error (the pole on the right part needs to be canceled). For that reason, a PID parallel controller is the first step in the control work flow.

\section{Simulated controller}

With help of the computational tool (MATLAB), it is nowadays easy to tune a controller with desired specifications. The current version includes a GUI tool that allows to move around the different control specifications for the selected system, checking continuously the result. It certainly reduces time and effort in the calculations and design.

Given the

\section{Results analysis}

The results of this work were not as satisfactory as expected, due to the bad behavior obtained from the Zumobot with the different designed controllers. It is clear that several reasons contribute to this factor, some of them can be stated as follows.

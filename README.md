# Zumobot

Repository for the Control Theory lecture Project.
Summer semester 2017 - Master Embedded Systems for Mechatronics - Fachhochschule Dortmund.

## General considerations

This project is based on the [Zumo 32U4 robot](https://www.pololu.com/category/170/zumo-32u4-robot) . Code is **under development**.

## Structure

The project contains MATLAB script code that generates the model and calculates all the constants to contol the system, and an Arduino code where those values should be implemented and tested into the robot. Independent Simulink model is added for testing pruposes.

* MATLAB script file with Control Model _model_zumo.m_
* Simulink model for macro testing _model.slx_
* Aduino file code _main_zumobot.ino_
